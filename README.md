# ⚡ **AI Cost Justification Analysis for AI Workloads**

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project explores how businesses can save money by optimizing AI infrastructure costs. We analyze **fixed energy costs** in relation to **actual usage rates** to uncover inefficiencies. 

The objective is to pinpoint areas where companies are overspending on underutilized infrastructure and offer **cost-saving recommendations**.

---
## 🧠 **Key Concepts**

### 🔹 **Cost Justification**
This refers to determining how much of your fixed infrastructure costs are truly justified by actual usage. If usage is low, part of the cost is essentially wasted.

### 🔹 **Threshold Logic**
- If **Average Usage < 70%**, part of the fixed infrastructure cost is deemed **wasted**.
- If **Average Usage ≥ 70%**, the infrastructure cost is **justified**.

### 🔹 **% Wasted**
This metric calculates how much of your infrastructure cost is being wasted due to underutilization.

## 📊 **Findings**

### Region: **eu-west**

- **Unused Capacity**: 26.09%
  
- **Insight**: A significant portion of fixed costs is wasted due to underutilized resources.
  
- **Recommendation**: To reduce waste, consider **optimizing your infrastructure** or **increasing AI workload usage**.

---

## 💡 **Business Impact**

- **Cost Reduction**: Pinpointing areas where infrastructure isn’t being fully used allows for **cloud cost optimization**.
  
- **Improved Decision Making**: By understanding usage patterns, businesses can make **data-driven decisions** on where to scale or cut back.

- **Increased Efficiency**: This project ensures that infrastructure costs are aligned with actual usage, helping businesses avoid unnecessary spending.

---

## 🛠️ **Tools Used**

- **Microsoft Excel**: Pivot tables, conditional logic, and charts for data analysis.
- **Data Cleaning & Aggregation**: Cleaning and preparing data to ensure accuracy.
- **Manual Cost Simulation**: Simulated costs based on usage thresholds.

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

- **Expand Analysis**: Scale the logic to handle larger datasets or integrate with cloud platforms like **Snowflake**.
  
- **Create Interactive Dashboards**: Build dynamic dashboards in **Tableau** or **Looker** for easier decision-making.

- **Revenue Operations**: Apply similar logic to optimize cost structures in business pipelines.

### 🚧 **Limitations**

1. **Simplified Model**: The analysis assumes basic infrastructure costs without factoring in maintenance or network latency.
  
2. **Data Scope**: This analysis only covers fixed costs; **variable costs** like data transfer are not included.

3. **Threshold Assumptions**: The 70% usage threshold is arbitrary and may need adjustment based on specific business needs.

4. **No Advanced Forecasting**: Future demand and cost forecasting are not included in this model.
